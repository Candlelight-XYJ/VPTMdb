# VPTMdb


**VPTMdb** is a comprehensive database for viral post-translational modification sites. We have collected 1240 PTM sites, which integrated 818 experimental-confirmed PTM sites in 43 viruses manually extracted from 150 publications and 422 PTMs extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. **VPTMpre**, a novel feature-based predctor was integrated in VPTMdb for users to predict phosphorylation sites of interests.


## Author summary
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) plays an important role in the regulation of viral proteins; However, due to the limitation of data sets, there has been no detailed investigation of viral protein PTMs characteristics. In this manuscript, we collected experimentally verified viral protein post-translational modification sites and analysed viral PTMs data from a bioinformatics perspective. Besides, we constructed a novel feature-based machine learning model for predicting phosphorylation site. This is the first study to explore the roles of viral protein modification in virus infection using computational methods. The valuable viral protein PTM data resource will provide new insights into virus-host interaction.
